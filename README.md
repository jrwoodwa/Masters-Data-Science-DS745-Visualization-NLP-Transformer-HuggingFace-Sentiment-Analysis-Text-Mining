### Oxford Dictionary Parsing and Sentiment Analysis
Are you ready to join me on cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) AI? I'm delving into the intriguing world of pre-trained NLP transformers for the first time. Therefore, I selected Python to experiment and analyzed all 35,000 unique words of the Oxford Dictionary for sentiment. To analyze sentiment, I will borrow insights from an NLP transformer model trained by Amazon product reviews (Peirsman, 2023). Join me and explore the English language, tokenize words, unveil sentiments in English vocabulary, and learn about NLP transformers.
